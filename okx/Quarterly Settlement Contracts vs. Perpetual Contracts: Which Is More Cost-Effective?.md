# Quarterly Settlement Contracts vs. Perpetual Contracts: Which Is More Cost-Effective?

Futures contracts come in two varieties: **quarterly settlement contracts** and **perpetual contracts**. The key distinction lies in their expiration: quarterly settlement contracts have a set expiration date, requiring settlement upon maturity, while perpetual contracts have no expiration date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely as long as they avoid liquidation.

Many beginners often wonder: 

- What are the differences between these two types of contracts in practice?
- Which is more cost-effective?
- How can you choose the appropriate contract type for different trading strategies?

This article will answer these questions. For an in-depth explanation of contract principles and calculation methods, refer to the [How to Calculate Margin, P&L, and Liquidation Prices in Perpetual Contracts](https://bit.ly/OKXe).

## Key Differences Between Quarterly and Perpetual Contracts

### Funding Rates in Perpetual Contracts

From a transaction fee perspective, there is minimal difference between quarterly and perpetual contracts. For instance, at **OKX**, both contracts feature a maker fee rate of 0.02% and a taker fee rate of 0.05%. However, the most notable cost distinction lies in **funding rates**, exclusive to perpetual contracts.

![Funding Rates Example](https://yibi123.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%87_20230529160648.png)

#### Key Points on Funding Rates:
- Funding rates ensure that perpetual contract prices remain anchored to global spot market prices.
- When the market skews bullish, perpetual contract prices tend to exceed spot prices, leading to **positive funding rates** where long positions pay short positions.
- Conversely, in bearish scenarios, funding rates may turn negative, requiring short positions to pay long positions.

**Calculation Formula**:  
`Funding Fee = Position Value Ã— Funding Rate`

#### Example:
A trader holding 1,000 ETH contracts (0.1 ETH per contract) with a mark price of $1,800 and a funding rate of -0.004% would calculate as follows:

1. **Position Value**:  
   `1,000 Ã— 0.1 Ã— 1,800 = 180,000 USDT`

2. **Funding Fee**:  
   `180,000 Ã— 0.004% = 7.2 USDT`

In this case, the short position pays 7.2 USDT to the long position. On OKX, funding fee details can be reviewed in the transaction history.

### Operational Flexibility: Quarterly vs. Perpetual Contracts

- **Quarterly Settlement Contracts**:  
  These contracts eliminate the hassle of funding fees but require settlement upon maturity. This can be limiting for traders holding positions during unfavorable market conditions, as they are forced to close the position, even if waiting could have turned a loss into a profit.

- **Perpetual Contracts**:  
  These offer greater flexibility, allowing positions to be held indefinitely as long as sufficient margin is maintained. However, traders must account for the recurring cost of funding fees, which can erode profits over time.

### Price Mechanisms: Mark Price vs. Latest Price

Price mechanisms significantly impact **P&L calculations** and **liquidation thresholds**. Using mark price, as opposed to the latest price, helps mitigate the risk of forced liquidation due to temporary price anomalies or "wicks."

At OKX, both quarterly and perpetual contracts use the following formula for mark price:  
**Mark Price = Spot Index Price + Moving Average Basis**

However, due to differences in basis calculation, the actual mark prices for quarterly and perpetual contracts often differ slightly.

### Risk Mitigation: Auto-Deleveraging vs. Clawback

- **Quarterly Contracts**:  
  Typically employ a "clawback" mechanism where profitable traders share the burden of losses from positions that cannot be liquidated due to extreme volatility.

- **Perpetual Contracts**:  
  Use an **auto-deleveraging (ADL)** system to reduce market risk, allowing users to close positions and withdraw profits at any time.

## Final Thoughts: Choosing the Right Contract

- **Perpetual Contracts**: Suitable for traders seeking operational flexibility and willing to manage funding fees.
- **Quarterly Contracts**: Better for those aiming to avoid recurring fees but who can manage the risk of mandatory settlement.
