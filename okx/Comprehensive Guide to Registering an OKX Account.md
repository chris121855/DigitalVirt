## Troubleshooting Registration Issues

### 1. Verify Your Information
Double-check the details entered, including phone number and email address.

### 2. Check Network Connectivity
Ensure your internet connection is stable. Switch between mobile data and Wi-Fi if necessary.

### 3. Address Duplicate Information
If the system indicates your phone number or email is already registered, verify whether you have an existing account. If yes, use the **Forgot Password** option to regain access.
