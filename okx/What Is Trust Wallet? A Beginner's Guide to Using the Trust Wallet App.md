## How Trust Wallet Works

Trust Wallet is a **non-custodial wallet**, meaning only the user has access to the private keys. Unlike custodial wallets (e.g., exchange wallets), Trust Wallet doesn‚Äôt hold your private keys or funds. 

### Key Security Features
1. **Backup Phrases**: Upon setup, Trust Wallet generates a 12-word backup phrase. This phrase acts as the master key to your wallet. It‚Äôs essential to store this phrase in a safe place, as it allows you to recover your wallet on a new device.
2. **Local Storage**: All data is stored locally on your device, encrypted, and never shared with third parties.
3. **Biometric Authentication**: Users can enable fingerprint or face recognition for added security.

By ensuring users have sole access to their private keys, Trust Wallet significantly reduces the risk of hacking.
