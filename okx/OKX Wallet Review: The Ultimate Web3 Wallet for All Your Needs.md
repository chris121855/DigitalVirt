## Key Features of OKX Wallet

### Cryptocurrency Storage
OKX Wallet offers a safe and decentralized way to store cryptocurrencies. Upon setup, users receive a **seed phrase**, which acts as a master key for accessing their assets. It is essential to keep this seed phrase private, as anyone with access can control your crypto holdings.

### Cryptocurrency Trading
Using OKX Wallet, you can interact with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like **Uniswap** or **CherrySwap** to trade tokens before they‚Äôre listed on major exchanges. However, DEXs may involve risks such as malicious tokens, so verify smart contracts before making trades.

### Passive Income with DeFi
OKX Wallet supports various DeFi protocols, enabling users to:
- Provide liquidity to AMM DEXs.
- Earn yields through lending protocols.
- Stake assets via liquid staking services.

DeFi offers lucrative opportunities but involves higher risks compared to centralized services like **OKX Earn**.

### NFT Management
The wallet connects to leading NFT marketplaces, including **OpenSea** and **LookRare**, allowing users to buy, sell, and mint NFTs. Creators can also use the **OKX NFT Marketplace** to monetize their artwork, set royalties, and launch projects through curated platforms like ‚ÄúPrimary/IGO.‚Äù
