## OKX Jumpstart Rules

OKX Jumpstart offers **two participation models**:

1. **Staking Model**  
2. **Discount Sale Model** (less common)

Currently, most events follow the staking model. Below is a breakdown of each method.

### A. Staking Model

In the **staking model**, you stake cryptocurrencies such as **BTC**, **ETH**, or **OKB** to receive new tokens as rewards.

- After the event ends, the staked tokens are returned, and you receive the new tokens.
- The reward is determined by the formula:  
  **Staked Token Amount / Total Staked Tokens Ã— Total Tokens Released Per Minute**
- All eligible users can participate and earn tokens.

### B. Discount Sale Model

Though less common, the **discount sale model** involves purchasing tokens at a discounted price.  
- Allocation is determined through a **lottery system**, ensuring fairness.
- Participants must carefully assess the risks, such as whether the token's post-listing price might fall below the purchase price.

## Example: OKX Jumpstart for ACE Token

In the recent Jumpstart event (Dec. 13, 2023), **ACE Fusionist** was the featured project, and the token was **ACE**. 

### Participation Requirements
1. Residents of East Asian countries (excluding Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Mongolia, North Korea, and Japan).
2. Completion of **KYC verification**.

### Staking Rewards Calculation
Staking rewards are distributed in real-time based on your share of the total staked tokens. For example:

- You stake **100 OKB**.
- Total staked OKB by all users is **100,000**.
- Tokens released per minute = **10,000**.

**Your reward per minute = 100 / 100,000 Ã— 10,000 = 10 ACE tokens.**

## Strategies for Risk Management and Maximizing Returns

### 1. Staking with Borrowed Funds
Borrow funds on OKX using assets like BTC or USDT as collateral. This method allows you to participate without liquidating existing holdings.

**Advantages**:
- **Lower capital pressure**: Use borrowed funds to stake without depleting your savings.
- **Diversification**: Allocate funds across multiple projects to spread risk.

**Note**: Borrowing comes with interest costs. Ensure the expected rewards outweigh the borrowing fees.

### 2. Hedging with Long/Short Positions
To reduce market risks, you can hedge by simultaneously buying and selling equivalent assets.

**Steps**:
1. **Buy Spot Assets**: Purchase BTC or OKB for staking.
2. **Open Short Contracts**: Hedge against price fluctuations by shorting the same asset on perpetual futures.

**Caution**: This method requires **two sets of funds**â€”one for the spot purchase and another for the short position.
